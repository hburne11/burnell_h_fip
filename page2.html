                <br>With their long flowing tails and vibrant colors, it's no wonder that bettas are one of the most popular fish for beginner aquarists. They are easy to care for and make a great ornamental addition to any desk, kid's room or living space. While female bettas are not as aggressive and can sometimes live together peacefully, male bettas are aggressive toward each other. Therefore, house only one male with smaller, peaceful fish in a community aquarium, or keep him alone.</p>

They will also usually not bother any fish that stays away from its territory, except when it is breeding it may tend to become more aggressive. They will breed every two weeks on a regular basis if the fry are removed shortly after hatching. However they are excellent parents and will not harm the fry even if left in the aquarium.

            <p>Tequila Sunrise Delta Guppy <br> These fascinating fish are livebearers who can rapidly reproduce in a community aquarium because they give birth to babies, rather than laying eggs. To aid in survival, provide hiding spaces for baby fish. Guppies are omnivores, which mean they eat both plan and animal matter, including small live foods and certain vegetables.</p>
